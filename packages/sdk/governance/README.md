# @planq-network/governance

Governance depends on @planq-network/contractkit and @planq-network/explorer.

It provides functions to read and interact with Planq Governance Proposals (CGPs).

Construct Planq Governance Proposals using either the `InteractiveProposalBuilder` class (for CLI apps) or `ProposalBuilder` (consumable via JS)
