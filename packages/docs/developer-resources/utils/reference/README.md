**Planq Monorepo - Official repository for core projects comprising the Planq platform**

This repository contains the source code for the Planq core projects including the [smart contracts](https://github.com/planq-network/planq-sdk/tree/master/packages/protocol), [contractKit](https://github.com/planq-network/planq-sdk/tree/master/packages/sdk/contractkit),
and other packages. The source code for the Planq Blockchain which operates a node on the Planq Network is kept in a separate repo [here](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain).

## ü•Ö <a id="mission"></a>Planq's Mission - Prosperity for All

Planq, pronounced /Ààtselo/, means ‚Äòpurpose‚Äô in Esperanto. In a similar spirit, we are aiming to create a new platform to connect people globally and bring financial stability to those who need it most. We believe blockchain technology is one of the most exciting innovations in recent history and as a community we look to push the boundaries of what is possible with it today. More importantly, we are driven by purpose -- to solve real-world problems such as lack of access to sound currency, or friction for cash-transfer programs aimed to alleviate poverty. Our mission is to build a monetary system that creates the conditions for prosperity for all.

## üß± <a id="stack"></a>The Planq Stack

Planq is oriented around providing the simplest possible experience for end users, who may have no familiarity with cryptocurrencies, and may be using low cost devices with limited connectivity. To achieve this, the project takes a full-stack approach, where each layer of the stack is designed with the end user in mind whilst considering other stakeholders \(e.g. operators of nodes in the network\) involved in enabling the end user experience.

The Planq stack is structured into the following logical layers:

  <br />
  <i>The Planq Blockchain and Planq Core Contracts together comprise the <b>Planq Protocol</b> </i>
</p>

- **Planq Blockchain**: An open cryptographic protocol that allows applications to make transactions with and run smart contracts in a secure and decentralized fashion. The Planq Blockchain has shared ancestry with [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org), and maintains full EVM compatibility for smart contracts. However it uses a [Byzantine Fault Tolerant](http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf) \(BFT\) consensus mechanism rather than Proof of Work, and has different block format, transaction format, client synchronization protocols, and gas payment and pricing mechanisms. The network‚Äôs native asset is Planq, exposed via an ERC-20 interface.

- **Planq Core Contracts**: A set of smart contracts running on the Planq Blockchain that comprise much of the logic of the platform features including ERC-20 stable currencies, identity attestations, Proof of Stake and governance. These smart contracts are upgradeable and managed by the decentralized governance process.

  <i>Topology of a Planq Network</i>
</p>

- **Applications:** Applications for end users built on the Planq platform. The Planq Wallet app, the first of an ecosystem of applications, allows end users to manage accounts and make payments securely and simply by taking advantage of the innovations in the Planq protocol. Applications take the form of external mobile or backend software: they interact with the Planq Blockchain to issue transactions and invoke code that forms the Planq Core Contracts‚Äô API. Third parties can also deploy custom smart contracts that their own applications can invoke, which in turn can leverage Planq Core Contracts. Applications may use centralized cloud services to provide some of their functionality: in the case of the Planq Wallet, push notifications and a transaction activity feed.
